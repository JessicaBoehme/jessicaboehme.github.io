            Transformative learning, as coined by educator Jack Mezirow,
            refers to the process through which individuals undergo a profound
            shift in perspective, beliefs, and values, leading to fundamental
            changes in their understanding of themselves and the world around
            them. Mezirow’s process includes the following:
          </p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg mb-4">
            <li>
              Disorienting Dilemma: A challenging experience prompts
              individuals to question their existing beliefs.

            <li>

          </ul>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            In a research project on transformative learning journeys in which
            the goal was for participants to develop a more relational
            philosophy, the greatest challenge is and has always been the
            action part or lack thereof. In Mezirow’s model, he stops right
            before resurfacing at “planning for action”. The actual action is
            missing. However, it’s sometimes easier to act your way into a new
            way of thinking than to think your way into a new way of acting.
            Ideally, philosophy-gyms are for workouts – and that involves
            actually doing something.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            But let’s unpack the whole process a little. To do that, we will
            build on the analogy of an ecosystem with mycelium (aka
            philosophy) in the heart and center.

        <div class="lg:col-span-2">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Everything starts somewhere, and although the metacrisis is the
            result of 10.000 things, the metacrisis — climate change, social
            inequalities, resource scarcity, species extinction, ocean
            acidification, escalating depression rates, unpredictable
            technologies, and post-truth rivalries, contributing to an
            increasing societal divide – is our starting point. (In Buddhist
            teachings, the number 10,000 symbolizes the multiplicity or
            abundance of phenomena in the world. It represents the countless
            beings, events, thoughts, and experiences that populate
            existence.)
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The metacrisis, though, is not an obstacle that we need to
            overcome but rather a circumstance that we need to adapt to. Just
            like a tree is subject to rain, sun and storms, as well as
            naturecultrual sources such as smog and fertilisers, the
            metacrisis is a system-crossing phenomenon – a political, social
            and ecological climate-change – that we are subject to.

        <div class="lg:col-span-2">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The tree here symbolizes what we see on the surface: it’s us and
            our actions, the infrastructures we designed, our habits and
            customs, and our political and economic systems. All the phenomena
            that we can observe with our senses. Although the visible part of
            the tree is commonly what we pay attention to with its majestic
            trunk, sprawling branches, and vibrant foliage, it is the hidden
            rooting system beneath the soil that provides the essential
            foundation and support for the tree’s growth, nourishment, and
            resilience.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            What informs how the tree is growing and whether it’s thriving or
            not depends as much on the roots of the tree as on its
            environment, such as the soil, storms, sun, wind, and rain. After
            all, the common saying is „to tackle the problem at its roots,“
            meaning that often enough, the real cause of things is hidden, not
            visible. Usually, common sayings are rooted in deep embodied
            collective wisdom.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The roots symbolize our collective and individual inner lives. The
            philosopher and integral theorist Ken Wilber defines the
            collective inner as the shared or collective aspects of
            consciousness that are common to groups, cultures, or societies.
            It encompasses the collective beliefs, values, norms, symbols,
            myths, and worldviews that shape the shared identity and
            experience of a community or society. These collective inner
            dimensions of consciousness are often expressed through cultural
            practices, rituals, traditions, and institutions.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The individual inner refers to the subjective, psychological, and
            spiritual dimensions of consciousness experienced by individuals.
            It encompasses the thoughts, emotions, perceptions, beliefs,
            intentions, and spiritual experiences that constitute an
            individual’s inner life.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Just like roots nourish and inform the tree, our collective and
            individual inner lives nourish and inform how we behave and what
            we create in the world. And as roots anchor the tree in the world,
            our inner lives anchor us when our outer part is subjected to
            circumstantial turmoil, helping us to show up even when the rain
            is heavy.

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            What roots the roots and makes it possible for the tree to connect
            to trees and other lifeforms is the mycelium.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Mycelium is the underground network of fungal threads that
            connects the roots of trees and forms a vast communication
            network, sometimes referred to as the „wood wide web.“ The
            mycelium is not assigned to a single tree but rather „infiltrates“
            large parts of the forest. Through this entanglement, mycelium
            enables trees to share information, such as distress signals, in
            response to environmental threats and to exchange nutrients,
            water, and chemical compounds with neighboring trees. This
            process, known as mycorrhizal symbiosis, is mutually beneficial,
            as trees provide sugars and carbohydrates to the fungi in exchange
            for essential minerals and water absorbed by the mycelium. And
            lastly, the mycelium is an adaptive system that continually adapts
            to changing conditions in order to be successful in different
            environments.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Philosophy is the mycelium of our times.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            „A philosophic outlook is the very foundation of thought and of
            life. The sort of ideas we attend to and the sort of ideas that we
            push into the negligible background govern our hopes, our fears,
            and our control of behavior. As we think, we live. This is why the
            assemblage of philosophic ideas is more than a special study. It
            molds our type of civilization. „Alfred North Whitehead.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Just as mycelium forms a network that facilitates communication,
            nutrient exchange, and mutual support among trees and other life
            forms in forest ecosystems, philosophy serves as the underlying
            narrative that connects and sustains our lives and helps us adapt
            to the ever-changing nature of the world around us.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Just as mycelium „infiltrates“ large parts of the forest,
            invisible on the surface, philosophies are often woven
            unconsciously into our habits and customs.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Just as mycelium demonstrates remarkable adaptability, philosophy
            can serve as an adaptive system of knowing, being, and acting that
            continuously evolves and adjusts to changing intellectual,
            cultural, and societal conditions in order to remain relevant and
            effective in different contexts.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The mycelium represents the heart of the philosophy-gym.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Most often, the philosophies we live by remain unconscious,
            adopted from our environment and upbringing. In the WEIRD world
            (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic),
            mechanistic ideas dominate, characterized by rationalism,
            reductionism, empiricism, dualism, and determinism, and this
            greatly influences how we address sustainability challenges. So,
            the initial step within the mycelium is becoming aware of our
            philosophical status-quo.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The second step within the mycelium then involves identifying
            better philosophies—better suited for engaging with the current
            reality. Relational philosophies acknowledge the fundamental
            interconnectedness and entanglement of the world and outperform
            mechanistic ones in addressing the metacrisis. They align more
            closely with the latest scientific insights and advocate for
            extending care and compassion to the whole.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Some might argue that there are no inherently better or worse
            philosophies. We disagree. While we think (with Ken Wilber) that
            there is value in all of the philosophies that we have relied on –
            also in mechanistic philosophies – we believe that there is
            progress and development in philosophies. If we didn’t believe
            that, then we’d also have to accept that life is completely
            arbitrary and without direction, everything would be equally good
            and bad, and we’d get lost in relativizing.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            „For more than a hundred years, researchers have studied the ways
            the human being constructs reality and have observed how that
            constructing can become more expansive, less distorted, less
            egocentric, and less reactive over time. When evolution occurs
            from one level of complexity to another, adults take greater
            responsibility for their thinking and feeling, can retain more
            levels of information, and can think further into the future, to
            name only some of the well-researched consequences of mental
            development.“ Robert Kegan and Lisa Lahey, 2016
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Like mycorrhizal symbiosis, philosophies can connect us to others
            while maintaining diversity. Instead of being in competition,
            philosophies can bring us into dialogue that evolves into
            cooperation, forming a functioning economy of mutual exchange in
            which we learn something from each other’s philosophy. A lack of a
            joint philosophy, though, increases the divide, leaving each
            member of the ecosystem unconnected.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The third step within the mycelium is, therefore, to „team
            philosophies.“ Rather than operating within isolated intellectual
            silos, individuals can learn to team up their philosophies. This
            involves recognizing and embracing the diversity of unique
            perspectives. While the mycelium forms its own network with
            distinct properties, it also simultaneously supports the
            individual tree, providing it with the necessary nutrients and
            resources to flourish. Teaming philosophies is about acknowledging
            that other people have other philosophies that they live by,
            trying to empathize with their philosophies, and figuring out how
            to relate to each other despite these differences, something that
            seems to have become more important than ever.

          Mushrooms

            Mushrooms are the fruiting bodies of mycelium. When conditions are
            suitable, mycelium may produce reproductive structures, which are
            what we typically recognize as mushrooms. Fruiting bodies are the
            visible, above-ground structures that emerge from the mycelium and
            serve as the means for the fungus to reproduce.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            When philosophies are practiced in everyday life, they come to the
            surface, not only in the form of a tree – informing how we are and
            what we create – but as their own entity – a new narrative that
            wants to spread by dispersing its spores.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The last step, therefore, is to actually practice living those
            philosophies, to exit the metaphysical meadow below the surface
            back into the real world. And this includes practicing on a daily
            basis.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            And that’s why philosophy-gyms are called philosophy-gyms. It is
            through life in forms of practice that things actually change. As
            Peter Sloterdijk says
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            „Practice is defined here as any operation that provides or
            improves the actor’s qualification for the next performance of the
            same operation, whether it is declared as practice or not.“
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            He also says, and we agree, that
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            „It is time to reveal humans as the beings who result from
            repetition. Just as the nineteenth century stood cognitively under
            the sign of production and the twentieth under that of
            reflexivity, the future should present itself under the sign of
            the exercise.“
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Exercising one’s philosophy, that is.

          Spores
        </h2>
        <div class="lg:col-span-2">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Spores can indirectly impact climate processes through their roles
            in ecosystem functioning and biogeochemical cycles. For example,
            when mushrooms release spores, they can contribute to the
            production of aerosols in the atmosphere. Aerosols are tiny
            particles suspended in the air, and they can play a role in cloud
            formation and precipitation processes. Spores released by
            mushrooms can act as cloud condensation nuclei, around which water
            vapor can condense to form clouds. This process can potentially
            influence local weather patterns by affecting cloud dynamics and
            precipitation.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Just like spores, when philosophies surface (when they are
            practiced), they influence the climate and create a new climate, a
            new circumstance that we need to adapt to – a „new metacrisis“ so
            to say. And this is where the loop almost closes. Except, it
            doesn’t, as the „new metacrisis“ is an evolved and changed version
            of what came before.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            How we live and practice our philosophy impacts global challenges,
            both on personal and systemic levels. This new way of living,
            though, will likely create new problems, better problems.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            While mechanistic philosophies played a pivotal role in
            innovations like the internet and comfortable housing, they also
            led to environmental degradation and avarice. The aim now is to
            integrate the advantages of mechanistic philosophies while
            transitioning into relational philosophies. The aim of the future
            will be to integrate the advantages of relational philosophies
            while transitioning into whatever emerging philosophies. The
            trajectory of improvement in philosophies, influencing how we
            design our lives, infrastructures, or cultures, has no halt. It’s
            always open to new possibilities and continuous improvement.

            “True philosophy entails learning to see the world anew.” Maurice
            Merleau-Ponty
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Or as John Stokdijk recently said
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            “Certainty about the truth is mostly a red flag. Very few people
            seem to understand that knowing truth can be a prison, …”
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Likewise, I don’t think a relational philosophy is “the truth.” I
            also think relational philosophies are very different for every
            person. Some might lean towards posthumanism, like Anthony Miccoli
            , and others, like Nathan Dufour Oglesby, more towards ecosophy
            (not that these two are exclusive).
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            To respond to the metacrisis, we need to learn exactly that: to
            see the world anew. PhilosophyGym are designed to do this,
            following the principles of an ecosystem. Practicing philosophy is
            a relational process. It’s mycelium-ing.
