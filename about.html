              BACKGROUND

              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                There are no easy solutions to the complex, interrelated
                challenges of the metacrisis. The metacrisis encompasses
                multiple crises such as global warming, social inequalities,
                scarcity of resources, species extinction, ocean acidification,
                increasing rates of depression, unpredictable technologies,
                post-truth rivalries, as well as an increasing divide within
                society. All these crises are characterized by volatility,
                uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (Schellnhuber, 2002) and
                can be understood as wicked problems (Pryshlakivsky and Searcy,
                2013).
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The challenge of wicked problems is that they have no clearcut
                solutions. Traditional approaches that focus on “outer
                transformation” such as technologies, policies, or
                infrastructures, have their limitations because they ignore the
                deeper philosophical underpinnings of the problems. Some (e.g.
                Akomolafe, 2023) argue that the way we address the crisis is the
                crisis.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Scientists from various disciplines therefore increasingly
                emphasize that an exclusively outer transformation is
                insufficient, and that an inner, philosophical transformation is
                necessary for regenerative futures (Böhme et al. 2022; Ives et
                al. 2019). Philosophies underlie deep, systemic structures,
                mechanisms and changes and can thus be both a barrier to or
                driver to overcome the challenges of the metacrisis (Escobar
                2017; Orr 2002).
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                To address inner transformation, we can built on practical
                philosophy. Practical philosophy has always been concerned with
                how we can train our philosophies in a practical and real-life
                way (Hadot 1995). Unlike medicine, law, or science, which
                provide concrete answers, practical philosophy encourages us to
                grapple with the unknown and to question our own assumptions. It
                brings to the centre the cultivation of individual and
                collective virtues for individual, societal and environmental
                regeneration (Caniglia et al. 2023).
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Philosophy is the inquiry into our understanding of reality,
                knowledge, and how we should live. As we assemble thoughts into
                coherent belief systems, we are essentially crafting
                philosophical frameworks. Similarly, when we discern between
                what is deemed good or bad, we draw upon philosophical
                foundations. How we design products, processes, or systems,
                depends on our philosophy. Philosophy is an inescapable facet of
                conscious experience, encompassing all dimensions of our
                understanding. Even to critique philosophy necessitates
                employing philosophical reasoning, a phenomenon known as the
                „performative contradiction”. Originating from ….philosophy.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                While our perceptions often associate philosophy with abstract
                theoretical discourse, ancient philosophy transcended mere
                intellectual exercise to become a way of life. For philosophers
                like Seneca, philosophy served as a guide to action rather than
                idle discourse. For him it was about practical application over
                theoretical speculation. He said that “philosophy teaches us to
                act, not to speak.” Genuine philosophical knowledge was measured
                not solely by intellectual prowess but by its integration into
                one’s daily existence, manifesting as a fusion of truth and
                personal embodiment (Hadot 1995). This translation of the
                theoretical into the practical and back requires persistent
                training (this is what we prepare for at the PhilosophyGyms). As
                the late Ludwig Wittgenstein said about philosophy as a
                “form-of-life”: “The work in philosophy is really more a working
                on oneself” (De Miranda 2023).
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Practical philosophy is a transformative, and largely
                overlooked, meta-technology.
              </p>
              <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Currently, there is a lack of addressing these inner dimensions
                in sustainability approaches – especially in institutions – be
                it universities, schools or workplaces. There are no spaces,
                where such capacities can be practiced – except privately. What
                is lacking are institutionalised offerings where people can
                practice cultivating a philosophy collectively (Caniglia et al.
                2023).
