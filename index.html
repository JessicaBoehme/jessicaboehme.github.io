              The conceptual and existential problems that our times
              pose are precisely those that have always been at the heart of
              humanistic inquiry: What does it mean to be human? What does it
              mean to live well? What is truth? What is good? These questions have
              no logical or empirical answers. They cannot be graphed or
              quantified. They are philosophical problems par excellence.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              <span class="font-bold">Mainstream approaches</span> to systems
              change that focus on “outer transformation” – such as
              technologies, (organisational) policies, or infrastructurces,
              have their limitations because they often ignore the deeper
              philosophical underpinnings of the problems. Scientists from
              various disciplines therefore increasingly emphasize that an
              exclusively outer transformation is insufficient, and that an
              inner transformation of our philosophies is necessary. To do
              that, we can built on practical philosophy.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              <span class="font-bold">Practical philosophy</span> has always
              been concerned with how we can train our worldview in a
              practical and real-life way. The philosophy that we often find
              in universities, which deals primarily with abstract ideas, is
              only a part of what philosophy actually was in ancient times,
              which was particularly about cultivating and practicing a
              worldview. Unlike medicine, law, or science, which provide
              concrete answers, practical philosophy encourages us to grapple
              with the unknown and to question our own assumptions. It brings
              to the centre the cultivation of individual and collective
              virtues – which are enduring and learned-by-doing capacities
              that emerge from experience, habituation and reflection – for
              individual, societal and environmental regeneration.

            OUR APPROACH
          </h2>
          <div class="lg:col-span-2">
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Philosophies are not equally helpful. We believe that a good
              philosophy is ecological at its core. Meaning it’s relational,
              while acknowledging individuality, and can continue to evolve
              throughout our lifespan. This evolution has a clear direction:
              increasing complexity, expansion, inclusiveness, objectivity,
              towards an <sup>eko</sup>philosophy.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Our approach is backed by science, but doesn’t stop there. There
              is so much valuable knowledge out there that has been
              disregarded, such as indigenous knowledge systems, but also
              tacit and embodied knowledge that cannot easily be measured and
              quantified. We try to speak to the head, heart and hand and
              believe that left hemispheric thinking (a focus on the parts)
              needs to be balanced with right hemispheric sensing (a defocus
              to the whole).

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              PhilosophyGyms are at the heart of what we do. They start by
              identifying the philosophy that gets us into existential knots,
              and then explores alternatives that can open up unseen
              possibilities. They are spaces in which asking the big questions
              about live are in the centre and most importantly, where they
              don’t stay in our heads but are practiced consistently – just
              like a good workout.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Many organizations aspire to adopt regenerative business
              practices, yet they find themselves entangled in a broader
              system that often conflicts with these principles as well as a
              lack of knowledge what the principles are. Our solution involves
              two key components: <br />
              (1) Providing philosophical guidance in navigating seemingly
              insurmountable challenges. <br />
              (2) Assisting in the development of regenerative business
              principles rooted in a philosophy that prioritizes relational
              dynamics, posthuman perspectives, systems thinking, and
              eco-feminist approaches.

              We envision a future in which philosophy-gyms are
              institutionalised: in schools, universities, and work places. We
              advocate for making philosophy-gyms available for everyone.

            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Philosophical Counselling</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Philosophical counselling is our version of
              one-on-one-PhilosophyGyms, if you prefer an intimate format. The
              power of philosophy in this context lies in its activity of
              exposing everything to questioning. When we feel stuck or lost,
              it is often due to perspectives, beliefs and values that seem so
              basic that we don’t even see an opportunity to reassess them.
              Philosophical counselling offers a way through.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Keynotes</h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
              If you are looking for a speaker at your event, please contact
              us so we find the best fit. Our topics revolve around how to
              live a good life, resilience, simplicity, the power of
              individual action, and understanding complexity all in the
              context of the Anthropocene.
